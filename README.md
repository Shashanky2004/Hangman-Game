# Hangman-Game
This Hangman API is built to intelligently guess letters in a Hangman game by leveraging n-gram probabilities. N-grams are sequences of letters, and this code uses unigrams, bigrams, trigrams, fourgrams, and fivegrams to estimate the likelihood of a letter occurring in a word of a given length.
